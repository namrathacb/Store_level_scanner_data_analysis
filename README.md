HUNT’S is the name of a brand of preserved tomato products owned by Conagra Brands. In Spaghetti Sauce category, it was the 6th largest brand in terms of revenue share, in 2001. As Brand Managers we try to predict parameters and their influence on the sales Spaghetti sauce. (From here onwards we might refer our product as HSS.)

We started with three questions:

Q1: What brand and market parameters affect/improve the revenue sales?

Q2: What parameters affect consumer decision for HSS’ selection?

Q3: How does the current/prospective HSS’ consumer look like?

By solving these three questions we aim to answer the main question: How to Sell More?
